Building libnavigate
====================

The libnavigate library is built using CMake 2.6+ (<http://www.cmake.org>) on all platforms.
It is tested to build on Linux and Windows for x86, x86-64 and ARM platforms without any
external dependencies.

On most systems you can build the library using the following commands

	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ cmake --build .

Alternatively you can point the CMake GUI tool to the CMakeLists.txt file and generate platform
specific build project or IDE workspace.
